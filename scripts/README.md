### inputs.yml

`inputs.yml` contains extra documentation for the inputs, which can't be extracted automatically from the manifest documentation. This text is added and maintained manually.

To use this, add text into the `input` key name, in a section that will be inserted into the template.

Currently, these sections are supported:

`title` -- Human-readable title for the input
`long_desc` -- A longer description of the input, which will be displayed at the top.
`setup_text` -- Text describing how to set up the integration.
