# Custom Logs (Deprecated)

The `log` input package for Elastic, primarily used by Filebeat, is designed to read and stream lines from various log files. It offers robust capabilities for monitoring specified file paths, collecting new log entries as they are written,
and forwarding them to Elasticsearch or other destinations. This input is essential for centralizing diverse log data from applications, servers, and other systems into the Elastic Stack for real-time analysis and troubleshooting.
